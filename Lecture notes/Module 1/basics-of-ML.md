# BASICS OF ML:

WHT IS **Artificial Intelligence** : building smart and intelligent machines

what is machine learning: a technique to implement ai that can learn from the data by themselves without being explicitly programmed.

what is deep learning :  is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neuro networks to learn from the data .

TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING :

MACHINE LEARNING :

  1. SUPERVISED LEARNING - LEARNS FROM LABELLED DATA 

     a. CLASSIFICATION - Predicts discrete values or labels ex : male or female

Algorithms: 

i). decision tree classification 

ii) random forest classification 

iii). K-nearest neighbor

     b. REGRESSION - Predicts continuous numerical values ex: salary, age

Algorithms:

 i)  logistic regression

 ii) polynomial regression

 iii). support vector machines

1. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING - LEARNS FROM UNLABELLED DATA

Algorithms used in unsupervised learning:

 i) K-means clustering

 ii) Hierarchical clustering

 iii) Principal component analysis (PCA)

 iv) Apriori algorithm

 v) Eclat algorithm

a. CLUSTERING - Groups similar data points together

b. ASSOCIATION - Discovers relationships between variables in large datasets

1. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING  - 1.Environment 2. agent 3. action 4. reward

basics of python:

intro about variables, data types

types of objects in python :

1. Immutable objects:
- numbers(int,float,bool)
- Strings
- Tuples
- Frozenset
1. Mutable objects:
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Sets
- Bytearray
